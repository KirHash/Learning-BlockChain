# Blockchain Introduction

## Smart Contracts
Decentralized agreements or Smart Contracts are a set of instructions that are executed in a decentralized autonomous way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary

## Oracle
Blockchain Oracle: It is any device that delivers data to these decentralized blockchain or runs external computation. 

Blockchain cant read or listen the data from the real world, this is known as the Oracle problem.

We need decentralized oracle system similar to the blockchain network. When the decentralized on chain logic combines with the decentralized off chain data and computation gives rise to hybrid smart contracts

## Purpose of Smart Contracts
The purpose of smart contracts:
a. It can not be altered(immutable)
b. It automatically executes
c. Everyone sees the terms of the agreement
d. Decentralization

## DAO
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a group completely decentralized by a set of instructions or smart contracts on chain

## Terminologies
1. Transaction Hash: It is an unique identifier for the blockchain that identifies an exact transaction
2. Block:
3. Transaction Fee: Amount paid to the miner for processing the transaction (Gas Price/Gas Fee)
4. Gas: It is a unit of computational measurement, the more complex a transaction is the more gas you pay.
5. Transactional Gas: Any transaction made on the blockchain comes with a transactional gas. The gas costs varies and depends upon the number of people sending transactions at the same time
6. Base Fee: It is the minimum gas price to send a transaction
7. Max Fee: It is the maximum gas price that we are willing to pay for a transaction
8. Burnt Fees: Whenever we are doing a transaction, some amount of digital currency is wasted, this called burnt fees
